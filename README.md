NOTE You have to add command "npm i" or "npm install" before running the program in your local environment.

Only use this command once on every installation of the given program.

The "PORT" variable will consist the port number that you will provide, "MONGO_URI" variable will contain your personal link String for mongoDB connection, and finally "SECRET_JWT_KEY" variable will contain any random string that you want to set for token validation process used in authentication.
